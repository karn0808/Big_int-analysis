#BigInt Library in C++
#A custom C++ library to handle big integer (BigInt) operations that exceed the limits of built-in integer data types. This library supports various arithmetic operations using operator overloading for seamless #integration with standard operators.

#Features
#Large Number Support: Perform arithmetic on numbers exceeding the capacity of standard data types.
#Operator Overloading: Uses operator overloading for natural syntax in operations.
#Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
#String Initialization: Initialize BigInt values directly from strings to avoid overflow issues.

Here are a few basic examples of BigInt usage:

cpp
Copy code
#include "BigInt.h"

int main() {
    BigInt num1("12345678901234567890");
    BigInt num2("98765432109876543210");

    BigInt sum = num1 + num2;
    BigInt difference = num1 - num2;
    BigInt product = num1 * num2;
    BigInt quotient = num2 / num1;
    BigInt modulus = num2 % num1;

    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Difference: " << difference << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Product: " << product << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Quotient: " << quotient << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Modulus: " << modulus << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
